The video game industry is a billion dollar industry with consumers all around the world.
However, video games are a relatively new invention. The "OXO" game, a computer generated version of tic-tac-toe, is often credited 
as being first video game, it was created by A.S. Douglas, a British professor, as apart of his dissertation at the
University of Cambridge. Eventually the Odyssey(Brown Box), first home video game console, hit the markets in 1972. In the 1970s and early 80s
some notable events that added to the video game industry's evolution were the creation of Space Invaders in 1978 and Donkey Kong which introduced the character to the
world.

In 1985 the at home video game industry was recovering from a crash and Nintendo released
the NES(Nintendo Entertainment System). In 1991 Sega released their follow up console 
to the Sega Master System, the Sega Genesis, starting the first of many console wars. With
the introduction of 3-D gaming a new console emerged, the Playstation. Sony's Playstation
dominated the market and Sega and Nintendo's consoles commercially flopped. The modern age of gaming
started in 2005 and 2006 with the release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Sony’s Playstation 3, and Nintendo’s Wii.
Video games have come a long way from x's and o's on a computer screen and have become the mode of expression.
